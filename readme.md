Python is a language in which you can do anything and everything. You just have to <b>FIND</b> the right function (for most of the basic parts). So if you are struggling on how to do something, here are the steps you need to follow:
  <ol>
    <li>Try to remember</li>
    <li>Google search and look into the documentation</li>
    <li>Google search and you will most probably find some stack overflow post</li>
    <li>Contact us</li>
  </ol>
  Also, as you can see, no GPT has been mentioned anywhere. So please try and avoid it as much as possible :) , but u can use gpt for learning 

Also, if you are still hungry for questions/want to learn more, you can freely contact me.

## Week 3


This week, our focus will be on learning basics of Web-Scrapping : Requests and BeautifulSoup. We will also explore JavaScript, knowledge of which will help us in scrapping dynamically rendered web-pages. Please go through [Week-3 README](./Week3-Resources/README.md).

Assignment for this week has been added. Find it [here](../Week3-Assignment).

## Week 4 

You can extend learning JavaScript to this week as well. It will be supplemented by Selenium. 

No assignment for this week :)
